 CSE 111 Proposal for a Student Chosen Program
1. What is the title of your program?
Window for Mars
2. What real-world problem will your program address or help to solve?
This will calculate when we will be able to launch our rockets to mars. We will use the checkpoint, Gateway Station orbiting the moon, as a halfway mark.
3. What will you learn from developing this program?
I will learn a little bit more about what goes into space exploration, as that is where I want to go into. 
4. What Python modules will your program use?
I am not sure but I think these are the modules I would need.
Solarsystem
Datetime
Mathplotlib
Math
pytest
   
5. Will you separate your Python program into functions that each
perform a single task?
Yes I will. I find it easier.

6. Will you write test functions to test at least two of your program
functions?
Yes I will.
